Some new dog owners think that they don't need to start teaching their dogs any commands until they reach a certain age. It's actually very important to start teaching your dog certain actions, or commands, as early as possible. Starting your training at an early age can help to build a solid foundation between you and your dog.

There are several basic commands that every dog owner should teach their dog. These commands can help you manage some common behavioral problems, like growling or trying to slip off their leash.

## Come to you

Sometimes your dog may slip off his leash if he sees a squirrel running by or escape into the backyard while you're taking out the trash. In these instances, it's best to use the come command to direct your dog towards you. If you plan on taking your dog off his leash, this is an essential command to know.

## Stay in place

The stay command can be difficult for dogs to master. However, this is an essential command for your dog to know. Sometimes, you need your dog to stay in one place. For example, if you drop something sharp on the floor, you might use the stay command to make sure your dog remains still while you clean up.

## Sit down

The sit command is one of the first commands you'll learn at The Good Dogs Project. Once your dog learns how to sit, you can transition to teaching her other commands like stay or wait.

Dog owners who enroll in our 12-week program will often start with learning these three commands. Eventually, you'll graduate to teaching your dog more difficult commands like drop it, leave it, or shake!
